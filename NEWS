# Version 0.2.99

- NEW: `SingleCurrencyMoney()` and `MultiCurrencyMoney()` allows you to create single and multi-currency money objects that are not date dependent
- NEW: `CashFlow()` allows you to create date dependent cash flows
- NEW: `FXRates()` and `ZeroCurves()` allows you to create tables of FX rates and zero curves for use in pricing.
- NEW: `PricingEnv()` allows you to wrap up `FXRates` and `ZeroCurves` into a single container with `pick()` allowing you select particular pricing elements.
- NEW: `build_fx_rates()`, `build_zero_curves()` and `build_pricing_env()` to enable the creation of associated objects using example market data
- FIXED: `pfc_calendar` field of `IborIndex` and `CashIndex` fields must now inherit from `Calendar` (#8). CashIndex and IborIndex constructors now support this.
- Internal change to class structure

# Version 0.2.0

Implement `ZeroCurve` and associated interpolation schemes and methods (#1)

- `ZeroCurve()` allows you to create zero curve objects from a set of discount factors and specifying the interpolation scheme to be used
- Implement a set of lightweight interpolation schemes including `ConstantInterpolation()`, `LinearInterpolation()`, `LogDFInterpolation()` and `CubicInterpolation()`. Their behaviour is determined by the object in which they are stored
- Implement a set of interpolation checkers `is.[X]Interpolation()`
- Provide convenience functions that source example market data and allows you to build a zero curve from one such data set (`fmdata_example()` and `build_zero_curve()` respectively.

# Version 0.1.0-99

- Fix title of one of the vignettes

# Version 0.1.0

- Initial version
- Exposes basic financial market building blocks as classes. These include
currencies, currency pairs, indices, interest rates and discount factors.
- Implements methods to create key instances of currency, currency pairs and
