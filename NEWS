# Version 0.2.99

- Internal change to class structure

# Version 0.2.0

Implement `ZeroCurve` and associated interpolation schemes and methods (#1)

- `ZeroCurve()` allows you to create zero curve objects from a set of discount factors and specifying the interpolation scheme to be used
- Implement a set of lightweight interpolation schemes including `ConstantInterpolation()`, `LinearInterpolation()`, `LogDFInterpolation()` and `CubicInterpolation()`. Their behaviour is determined by the object in which they are stored
- Implement a set of interpolation checkers `is.[X]Interpolation()`
- Provide convenience functions that source example market data and allows you to build a zero curve from one such data set (`fmdata_example()` and `build_zero_curve()` respectively.
