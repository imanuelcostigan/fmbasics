  Benchmark instances of these objects which have been defined using their most
  common conventions or those defined by International Swap Dealer Association
  (ISDA, <http://www2.isda.org>) legal documentation. Foundational pricing 
  objects can also be created including zero curves and tables of FX rates. These
  pricing objects can be brought together into a pricing environment.
